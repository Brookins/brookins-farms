##Description
'''
I created a website for my family farm operation. They have very little web presence and I thought this would be the first step to building something for them.

##Customer CSS classes
'''
1. Archer Created this class to group the top section of the webpage with the family picture and small text below
2. links Created for formatting of the links to other pages that will be created later on
3. content-farm Created to for CSS flexbox on the major component of the website
4. family pic Created to format picture to cut off and show as an oval

##Custom JavaScript Function
'''
I created a quiz at the bottom of the page asking about information that can be derived from reading the text.
It is multiple choice and when the person hits "Get Results", the function runs and returns how many were answered correctly and color codes the questions by if the person choose correctly or not.
